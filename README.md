Life

Rules of the game

The first generation is the position of the game cells at the beginning of the game. We will fill it randomly. Each new generation is calculated based on the previous one according to the following rules:

In an empty cell, next to which there are exactly three living cells, life is born.
If a living cell has two or three living neighbors, then this cell continues to live. Otherwise, the cell dies (from "loneliness" or "overpopulation").
The game is terminated if no living cells remain on the field or at the next step, no cell changes its state (a stable configuration develops).
